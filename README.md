Weather app in under 10k
A simple weather app that delivers the goods in under 10k. Works just as well in lynx and modern browsers.
If your browser suppots js, it handles requests for new weather though an ajax call with a cool animation. It also creates an svg on fly to show a graph of the weeks upcoming weather.
If not, it uses the location as a GET variable and displays the weather.
